Happy *(insert winter holiday here)* from your friend Eric Moe! This year I designed a Christmas postcard I sent to friends and family. Lots of positive feedback and holiday wishes, but a few people asked me who I hired to illustrate my card (ðŸ™„). This was a quick oneâ€” I submitted the design for print and sent out my physical copies within a week of Christmas. I am posting it today because my illustration of the Barton Springs Polar Bear Plunge happens tomorrow! If you want to see me participate, check out [@geomoetric](/geomoetric/) for the winter shenanigans.
