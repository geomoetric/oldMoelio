# UT Annual Impact Report

Cover— (right) Here is the behemoth of the semester. At my UT job, this was top priority for two months. The Annual Impact Report summarizes donor support and scholarly initiatives of the school year for UT's very own Department of Liberal Arts. To the right you can see my favorite cover out of the eight I created. In the background is the Liberal Arts Buildings, and the beautiful GT Sectra is on display in the foreground. It really is a great font as long as it stays all caps— but hey, that could be my slab-serif love talking again. 

# Liberal Arts Honors

You might notice that this photo is heavily edited if you were to examine it closely. The truth is, whoever took this photo should have taken it portrait mode to get the Washington monument in. That seems like common sense to me!

# Study Abroad 

At first I did not like this spread. My boss wanted a photo from the student who studied abroad in England— specifically this very green photo that I felt was boring. Sure, we are Texans, and a green hill is relatively rare, but the photo did not do much for me. Yet when all was said and done I liked the calming unity this picture creates in cooperation with my layout. 

# Back Cover

The truth is that this project taught me InDesign. I dabbled beforehand sure, but the scope and breadth of this project demanded me to hone my skills, and has enabled me to create this book that much faster and better.
