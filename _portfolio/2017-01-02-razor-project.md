In case you did not know, I am a genetic Scandinavian anomaly in this great state of Texas. My body thinks we’re about to hook up the reindeer to go ice-fishing, yet outside it has not been sub 70 in the whole month of November. 
So when we were tasked with redesigning a common tool, I scratched my freshly shaved stubble and realized it had to be the razor. Not just any razor either, my razor of choice in my 8 years of shaving— the safety razor.

I compared electric, straight, disposable, multi-blade, and safety razors on a number of metrics, and the humble safety razor was the clear winner. So why is the safety razor a relict of a bygone age if it is so effective?

My design aims to update the safety razor for modern shaving habits. A grooved grip and weighted head let the razor fall at a perfect 45° angle on your face. Both the razor and the stand it ships with reduce waste caused by manufacturing and planned obsolescence. All in all, these adjustments and countless other subtleties will support a fantastic shave every time— isn’t that what razors are all about?

See, I was not lying about the beard! This is what the 3D print of my razor looks like. In the end I created sixteen or so prints of my razor. Sometimes, the prints themselves failed, rendering strange, contorted death blades. Other times, my model would be incorrect. I realized too late that my razor did not hold standard double-sided blades— an issue promptly fixed.

I envision this razor cast in stainless steel. If I were to take this concept farther, it would be my hope that this realized razor would be a treasured item for men and women to keep their entire lives.

Here are a few shots from my website proposal you can find [here.](/portfolio/2016-11-28-razor-website/) Truthfully, I put this together very quickly, but as an exercise in branding, lean development, and late night achievement, I believe it is successful.
