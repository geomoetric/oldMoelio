# Portfolio Website
Ah ericmoe.co. Light of my life, fire of my loins, pet project obsession of my fall semester. That’s right, I spent all of my free time goofing around by making this site. It is hosted on Github Pages for free and runs on Jekyll. here are some of the notable features—
@geomoetric— (right) A social media hub. I later repurposed the code as a way to share on every page.
PORTFOLIO— (next page) My splash page. I reconfigured the 3 tier grid to scale with a device— before this the three pics would scale into weird, indecipherable bars. 
Checklist— (p. 44) My big checklist as I went through this process. I consider this text so it does not break my formatting rules
COPYRIGHT— (p. 45) A good example of typography/readability.
ABOUT— (p. 46) My about page.
