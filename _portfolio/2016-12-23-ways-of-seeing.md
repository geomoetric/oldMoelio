# Ways of Seeing 

Final— (right, next pages) I want to get away from this election, but I did the bulk of my photography on the evening of November 8th, so it’s hard to divorce that experience from this project. 
I was assigned a tack and my project was to make the tack represent a list of words assigned to us. I was interested in framing the tack with human anatomy, so I am the subject of these photos. Quick shout out to my father, Thomas Moe, who lent me his astounding camera to take these shots. Oh man, I have to get that camera back to him before he gets mad now that I think of it. 
Nervous— (right) I proposed this photo at a different angle, and my classmates said it looked fake. I rotated it 95° and they said they loved the new photo. 
Curious— (page 28) This was a rough shoot because of the direct light in my eyes. I ended up editing out the tears.
Tender— (page 29) Has science gone too far? Did my father’s camera capture too much detail in this shot?
Clumsy— (page 30) I took 200 photos of this shot. The words “motion photography” bring flashbacks of flashbulbs.
Loud— (page 31) A few of my classmates said that “snug” would be a better fit for this pic. I worry about these people.
