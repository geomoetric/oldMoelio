# Turkey Trot Infographic

Detailâ€” (right) The only project from Brenda Thompson Communications, this is an infographic on various figures from the turkey trot. Ultimately, I believe that this square layout limited me, but perhaps If I had the ability to devote more time to it things would have been different. 
It is surely obvious that this was nearly designed by committee. I love the tradition of the ThunderCloud Subs Turkey Trot Art Contest, but that hand drawn turkey really does not make sense in the context of the infographic. Half of the icons were graciously borrowed from the noun project, can you tell which ones I created?
