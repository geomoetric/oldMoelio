One fun fact about this piece— the blue is the same hex value as the blue on the US flag (#002868).

I am afraid I am an internally political person. Blame it on apolitical parents, midwestern sensibilities, a hesitation to argue without facts— I rarely voice my opinions through my art. The re-approptiation grid project aimed to let my political classmates vent their views in a creative way while learning about visual grid structures. 

Here you can see a detail of my diagonal halftones. It’s a technique I have used in the past but I find myself gravitating toward it again and again. There is something magical about an image that appears only at the right distance.


Ultimately, I think that political art easily alienates and dates your work. Therefore, this message of voter empowerment seemed to fit my centrist leanings while sharing a message that everyone can get behind. 

We finished this project before the election of the 45th President of the United States. I think about that critique when my classmates voiced their political opinions at great length only to reveal that a majority had failed to register to vote. I think about the five or so students that I got to vote and the outcome in Austin vs that of the US. I think back to the excitement I had for the political process I had then and the dread I feel looking at my news feed today. I consider where our 45th president would go within this diverse spread of this poster— whether he has a place in this America or whether I have a place in his America.
