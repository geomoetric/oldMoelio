Welcome to my new website! Hand coded, self-hosted, and hopefully not brokenâ€” I am finally done with it. 

Right now you will notice there are not that many posts, so check in every so often as I update the [portfolio page]({{ site.url }}) with completed works and the [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog/) with WIPS and writing. In the meantime, you can check out some [postcards]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/2016-11-2-ut-postcard/) I made for UT or you can check out some [mac art]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/2016-11-1-mac-art/) I created this summer.

There are a few fun parts of the site too. There is a page where you can find all my [social media](https://www.geomoetric.com). If you want to ogle my [resume]({{ site.url }}/resume/) or my [about page]({{ site.url}}/about/), feel free. There is a really long [copyright page]({{ site.url }}/copyright/) if you want to see a lot of typography. You can even make it rain pizza at the [404 page.]({{ site.url }}/404.html/)

Anyways, thank you for stopping by. Let me know if you find something you like!
