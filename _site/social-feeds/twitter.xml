            <title>UT &quot;Arc&quot; Poster: /portfolio/2017-03-06-arc/ #architecture #utaustin</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;col three lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ericmoe.co/img/arcweb2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am nothing if not a fan of classic art school projects, yet I seem to always miss the professors who assign them. I have never been charged to draw 1000 circles, or 500 hands, or set the &lt;a href=&quot;https://studyingdesign.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/five-classic-typefaces/&quot;&gt;five classic type faces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So imagine my delight when we were assigned to set the type for &lt;a href=&quot;https://soa.utexas.edu/life-work/events&quot;&gt;UT’s Architecture Lecture Series&lt;/a&gt;, a time-tested assignment for all designers! My design was heavily inspired by Michael Beirut’s run of &lt;a href=&quot;https://architecture.yale.edu/school/publications/poster-archive&quot;&gt;Yale Architecture Lecture posters&lt;/a&gt;. I love working in black and white, and I enjoyed playing with a minimal typographic sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img_row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;col one lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ericmoe.co/img/arcweb3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;westie sticker&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;col two lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.ericmoe.co/img/arcweb4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;westie sticker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few details of the letters as buildings. I wanted to convey the line quality that unifies these UT lecturers in their architectural work. This &lt;em&gt;abstract letter as building as architectural plan as three-dimensional space&lt;/em&gt; seemed to do the trick. Plus, this poster looks fantastic from far away— with college kids you have to do everything you can to snatch their eyes from their phones or your poster will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Singularity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my most recent commissions was for a UT New Works play titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2017/04/04/student-play-gives-voice-to-struggles-of-syrian-refugees&quot;&gt;“A Singularity”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch the play this Thursday, April 13, 2017
8:30 PM – 10:00 PM (more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-singularity-tickets-33269303382&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a meaningful play created by passionate people, and a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2017/04/04/student-play-gives-voice-to-struggles-of-syrian-refugees&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailytexanonline.com&quot;&gt;Daily Texan&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of summarizing the play and the story that surrounds it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A Singularity” is a student-written play by Carleigh Newland, Kelsey Linberg and Tess Jackson premiering on April 10th at the Cohen New Works Festival. The play follows a Syrian refugee, Amena, and her family as she comes of age, dreams of becoming an astronomer and finds a place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I want this play to hit people and make it where these refugees are not just numbers on a page,” Linberg said. “They are real people. They laugh; they smile; they hug their mom; they get in fights with their brothers; they have crushes; they fall in love.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Newland, the production lead and co-writer on the project, said she wanted to focus on the refugee crisis after spending last summer interning at The Refugee Project in Houston, a nonprofit that helps women refugee communities integrate into American society. She said she learned a lot and developed a deep passion to help raise awareness about the refugee crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people enforce these really negative stereotypes on (refugees),” Newland said. “They are just families wanting to pursue their dreams and trying to resume the lives they had in different places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design-wise, this was a rush job. The theater department is fast, loose, and behind on their deadlines, so imagine a 4 day turn around followed by weeks of silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hijab was at points a source of contention. Directors are often interested in literal representation in their posters, aka this prop needs to be the same color on the poster. However, the suggested color provided to me was a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear, I have no intention to misrepresent traditional  Syrian clothing, but there were issues with the mustard yellow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This yellow was impossible to reproduce on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hatopress.net/printing/&quot;&gt;risograph print&lt;/a&gt;— the eco-friendly printing method I created these posters with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was a legitimate concern that these head and shoulders would look like male genitals if rendered in that mustard color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution was to produce a muted red color that printed well and satisfied all concerns. I think that both director and designer got a lot out of this collaboration. Those directors will understand the choices made by future poster designers, and I have a new appreciation for humanity both near and far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found this post interesting, or want to learn more about the production, I encourage you to see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-singularity-tickets-33269303382&quot;&gt;play.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Donezo! 2016 Fall Semester in Review</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;col three&quot; src=&quot;/img/donezoweb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col three caption&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dust has settled on the Fall Semester— and what a semester it’s been. Fall 2016 was officially the beginning of my design coursework at UT. Having completed all my preliminary work, I was free to take courses on graphic design, typography, and product design. On top of that, I worked two jobs, finished this website, and completed some top notch design work that I will post soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been eagerly awaiting college design classes since the seventh grade, and I am happy to report that all three were fantastic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.husbandmen.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JimJames Walker’s&lt;/a&gt; Images in Communication was my straight graphic design course, covering Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, RAW photography, and Indesign, to name a few programs. Alyson Beaton’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://abeatontype.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Typography I&lt;/a&gt; class had me putting layouts and books together with my favorite fonts. I even designed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2016-11-28-razor-website/&quot;&gt;new kind of razor&lt;/a&gt; for Kate Catterall’s Introduction to Design Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I wrapped up my job at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brendathompson.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brenda Thompson Communications&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned for a post about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuu.com/lifeandletters/docs/ll_fall2016_issu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Life and Letters Magazine&lt;/a&gt; illustrations I did for UT Liberal Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big milestone this semester was the sophomore review. In what seemed like the busiest day of my life, I presented my design pieces to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.utexas.edu/academics/design-faculty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UT design faculty&lt;/a&gt; for evaluation. We had a great conversation, the feedback was helpful, and I am happy to report that I am on track to graduate. I also added this “script” I prepared that might give you an idea of how it went down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Morning! My name is Eric Moe, and I am thrilled to be a sophomore Design major, even at 8 AM! So I believe I was asked to pick two favorite pieces, or two pieces to contextualize my design practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I cannot choose a favorite child so I am choosing my source book as one of my pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It contains work from all of my classes and from my design jobs at Brenda Thompson Communications and UT liberal Arts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This book is based on old field guides. I gravitate toward classic techniques and mid-century aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am interested in how I could apply classic craft, like sign painting, Rockwell-esque illustration, and modernist forms in twenty-first-century contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This brings me to my second piece, my design website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hand coded this in my free time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s very simple— a static site generator with some automated social media processes, but I am beaming with pride.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has also established a precedent for how my design practice should continue outside of the classroom, and how I apply what I am learning to my personal work.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For example, I use Alyson’s lessons on type to create a readable site,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I use Jim’s training on visual clarity to streamline navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I use Kate’s worldview exercises to establish what will make my online presence stand out in the void.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I would like to thank you for your time and take any questions about my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• What do you find most interesting about design?
&lt;strong&gt;The positive effects it has on people’s lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• What kind of designer do you think you’d like to be?
&lt;strong&gt;I would like to be a designer who embraces the 21st-century technology with 20th-century skill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• If you could change the works on display, what changes would you make?
&lt;strong&gt;I honestly would rather start a new work entirely than change an old one. I have to complete pieces. There need to be periods and exclamation marks in my life, not just commas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• What have you learned thus far in the design program and what would you like to learn in the future? &lt;strong&gt;This program has taught me how to design on a professional level. Yes, I knew color composition and adobe illustrator going into this program— UT elevated the way I think and the way I work to be even more efficient and creative. I hope to learn more tech and web related design mediums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Do you have any questions for the faculty? &lt;strong&gt;What are your favorite Design Books?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
