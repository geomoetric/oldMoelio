Would it surprise anyone to hear that my favorite design period of the 20th Century is Mid-Century Modernism? Maybe that is a cliche of design students, but what can I say? Between the colors, the forms, the photography, and the optimism, I say there is a lot to like!

Imagine then my surprise at being assigned Mid-Century Modernism as my final project in [Dr. Monica Penick's](https://designcreativetech.utexas.edu/monica-penick) History of Design course. I was jazzed to say the least.

I had the privilege of working with several other premier designers on this project. [Anna Steinhagen](https://annasteinhagen.squarespace.com/work/) designed the geometric fern pot, [Alexander Kim ](https://www.facebook.com/alex.kim.92798) created a wooded box light, [Jake Bruner](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011794893572) and [Dessa Gilbert](https://www.instagram.com/itsdessa/) collaborated on the structure and wallpaper of our space. It seemed like a stress-free group project, and I am indebted to my cohort for their fantastic output.

My contribution was the sculptural flat-pack chair. It shares the same profile as an [Eames molded plastic chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/side-chairs/eames-molded-plastic-chairs/) but is easy to assemble, sourced from renewables, and transports with ease. My chair, along with the rest of our modeled living room, aimed to take the ideas of Mid-Century Modernism into the 21st Century. In that respect I believe we were successful.

This diorama served to mock up an exhibit at an imaginary design fair akin [The Great Exhibition of 1851](https://www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/the-great-exhibition). It was necessary to mock up a few print materials advertising our project, and I was lucky enough to design our poster featuring my funky looking chair.

That chair has bounced around my head for two years, and I am thrilled to have finally used it in a project. I hope this is not the last time I get to work with such a fascinating period of design.
