I am nothing if not a fan of classic art school projects, yet I seem to always miss the professors who assign them. I have never been charged to draw 1000 circles, or 500 hands, or set the [five classic type faces](https://studyingdesign.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/five-classic-typefaces/).

So imagine my delight when we were assigned to set the type for [UT's Architecture Lecture Series](https://soa.utexas.edu/life-work/events), a time-tested assignment for all designers! My design was heavily inspired by Michael Beirut's run of [Yale Architecture Lecture posters](https://architecture.yale.edu/school/publications/poster-archive). I love working in black and white, and I enjoyed playing with a minimal typographic sensibility.

    <img class="col two lazyload" data-action="zoom" src="{{ site.imgurl }}/img/arcweb4.png" alt="" title="westie sticker"/></div> 

Here are a few details of the letters as buildings. I wanted to convey the line quality that unifies these UT lecturers in their architectural work. This *abstract letter as building as architectural plan as three-dimensional space* seemed to do the trick. Plus, this poster looks fantastic from far awayâ€” with college kids you have to do everything you can to snatch their eyes from their phones or your poster will not work.
