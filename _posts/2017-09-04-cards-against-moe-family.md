Many people are familiar with [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), but I would bet that few families are quite as dedicated as the Moes when it comes to playing. Every holiday, get-together, and opportune moment, we do our best to take our deck out. Does this make us terrible people?

So after several years and several dog-eared expansions, we found ourselves in a rut. Eventually you know all the cards, and the shock begins to wean. Fortunately, I happen to be a designer who needed a mothers day present, and Cards Against Moe Family hit it out of the park.

Design wise this project was easy. Helvetica! Black and White! Even the captions came quickly as the four of us brainstormed 300 cards that we whittled down to about 162. The hard part was organizing and editing the cards so they made sense grammatically when combined. In that respect I could have used an editor!

I recognize that most of these cards pictured are shameless inside jokes, but this project is greater than that. I loved the experience of working with a niche card game printer, and in the future I hope I can work on another card or board game!
