I sincerely doubt that this is blog-worthy, but I thought I might as well make a post to commemorate this blunder permanently. If you are familiar with my work or this site, you might have noticed the abundance of social media outlets I use to cross-post my design work. Occasionally I run into a few bugs  as evident by this woefully cropped tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few more web experiments, this one was to illustrate Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales by Car Seat Headrest. More at <a href="https://t.co/xsBhsUuUAc">https://t.co/xsBhsUuUAc</a>... <a href="https://t.co/dy3qiFPZgk">pic.twitter.com/dy3qiFPZgk</a></p>&mdash; Eric Moe (@geomoetric) <a href="https://twitter.com/geomoetric/status/907250198069510145">September 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

While I realized my mistake in mere hours, I did not clue into how I was amassing so many likes so quickly. Is my social media strategy completely bonkers? Should I just post nonsensical tweets? Is [ericmoe.co/porf](ericmoe.co/porf) a viable domain name?

Nope, just somehow got re-tweeted by critically acclaimed Will Toledo of [Car Seat Headrest](https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/). Since this is my only piece of design I would remotely consider "fan art," I guess I have peaked and it's time to quit while ahead.
