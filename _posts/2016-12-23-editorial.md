This was a project made for someone who has read a newspaper since the first grade. Our prompt was to take Op-Ed articles without formatting, set them in InDesign, and provide editorial illustrations. Below are my final designs, set in the style of the [New York Times Op-Ed page](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/09/25/opinion/opedat40-illustration.html?_r=1&){:target="_blank"}. Nothing quite like that [Grey Lady](https://books.google.com/books?id=tE4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA152&dq=%22the+gray+lady%22+%22new+york+times%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tokrT_DMKK7aiQKwttTgCg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20gray%20lady%22%20%22new%20york%20times%22&f=false){:target="_blank"} combo of [Imperial](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/imperial/?refby=MarkFonts){:target="_blank"} and [Bookman](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bookman/?refby=MarkFonts){:target="_blank"}. 

### This Algorithm's Taste in Wine is Better than Yours

This design started as a goofy doodle that eventually materialized as a boozy robot and his trusty human companion. I think the funky print effect is the better treatment between the two.

### The Doll in the Blue Pantsuit

In this op-ed, the imagery of the doll seemed too on the nose for my purposes, so I used doll packaging as the foundation of the piece. It is meant to be a narrative that describes the popular demand each candidate experienced through that American pastime of vicious shopping.
