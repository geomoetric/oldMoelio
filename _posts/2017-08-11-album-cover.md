The point of this class project was to lay bare everyone's taste in music. Sure, the assignment brief called for an analysis and redesign of a favorite album cover, but we all know the real reason was an all out hipster-art-school-music-design-snobbery-fest. I knew I had to flex my music muscles, and I chose to redesign the cover for King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard's [*Paper Mâché Dream Balloon*](http://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/).

When I began the project in earnest, I found this snobbery ploy to be less compelling than the actual re-design process. The original cover above falls short of conveying the theme of the album, and I feel that a redesign can solve some of those problems.

In the Gizzard's discography, this album is unique in its departure from paranoid acid rock to "mellow, de-fuzzed psychedelia." To me, the emphasis on the toned down acoustic guitar overlaying lyrics with subversive meaning defines the album.

My redesign takes a normal scene of friends gathered around the campfire and completely distorts it. The band members become trippy visions. The print is warped and interacts with the type to convey a reverence for the bootleg psych albums of old.

With such a fun name, I've never understood why these guys would not depict a Lizard Wizard or King Gizzard on their album. Fortunately, I was able to correct this missed opportunity.

I think this is a successful piece, bolstered by a fantastic critique. For a nosy person like me, it was *very* fun to dive into other people's music tastes. Music is such a personal form of entertainment, especially for college students, and combining that with a critique led to some fiery discussions. Just goes to show that an ulterior motive for a class project is not always what it seems to be!
