The dust has settled on the Fall Semester— and what a semester it's been. Fall 2016 was officially the beginning of my design coursework at UT. Having completed all my preliminary work, I was free to take courses on graphic design, typography, and product design. On top of that, I worked two jobs, finished this website, and completed some top notch design work that I will post soon.

I have been eagerly awaiting college design classes since the seventh grade, and I am happy to report that all three were fantastic. [JimJames Walker's](https://www.husbandmen.com/){:target="_blank"} Images in Communication was my straight graphic design course, covering Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, RAW photography, and Indesign, to name a few programs. Alyson Beaton's [Typography I](https://abeatontype.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} class had me putting layouts and books together with my favorite fonts. I even designed a [new kind of razor]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/2016-11-28-razor-website/) for Kate Catterall's Introduction to Design Thinking.

In other news, I wrapped up my job at [Brenda Thompson Communications](https://www.brendathompson.com/){:target="_blank"}. Stay tuned for a post about the [Life and Letters Magazine](https://issuu.com/lifeandletters/docs/ll_fall2016_issu){:target="_blank"} illustrations I did for UT Liberal Arts. 

A big milestone this semester was the sophomore review. In what seemed like the busiest day of my life, I presented my design pieces to the [UT design faculty](https://art.utexas.edu/academics/design-faculty){:target="_blank"} for evaluation. We had a great conversation, the feedback was helpful, and I am happy to report that I am on track to graduate. I also added this "script" I prepared that might give you an idea of how it went down:

___

Good Morning! My name is Eric Moe, and I am thrilled to be a sophomore Design major, even at 8 AM! So I believe I was asked to pick two favorite pieces, or two pieces to contextualize my design practice.

**Source Book**

- I cannot choose a favorite child so I am choosing my source book as one of my pieces.
- It contains work from all of my classes and from my design jobs at Brenda Thompson Communications and UT liberal Arts
- This book is based on old field guides. I gravitate toward classic techniques and mid-century aesthetics. 
- I am interested in how I could apply classic craft, like sign painting, Rockwell-esque illustration, and modernist forms in twenty-first-century contexts.

**Website**

- This brings me to my second piece, my design website.
- I hand coded this in my free time.
- It's very simple— a static site generator with some automated social media processes, but I am beaming with pride.
- It has also established a precedent for how my design practice should continue outside of the classroom, and how I apply what I am learning to my personal work.
    - For example, I use Alyson's lessons on type to create a readable site,
    - I use Jim's training on visual clarity to streamline navigation.
    - I use Kate's worldview exercises to establish what will make my online presence stand out in the void.

With that, I would like to thank you for your time and take any questions about my work.

____

• What do you find most interesting about design?
**The positive effects it has on people's lives.**

• What kind of designer do you think you’d like to be?
**I would like to be a designer who embraces the 21st-century technology with 20th-century skill.**

• If you could change the works on display, what changes would you make?
**I honestly would rather start a new work entirely than change an old one. I have to complete pieces. There need to be periods and exclamation marks in my life, not just commas.**

• What have you learned thus far in the design program and what would you like to learn in the future? **This program has taught me how to design on a professional level. Yes, I knew color composition and adobe illustrator going into this program— UT elevated the way I think and the way I work to be even more efficient and creative. I hope to learn more tech and web related design mediums**

• Do you have any questions for the faculty? **What are your favorite Design Books?**
