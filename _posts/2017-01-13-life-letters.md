Here's an unexpected project. As I was recovering from the intense Impact Report, I was given what seemed like a tiny assignment for UT's own Liberal Arts Magazine. No, I was not given the cover of [Life & Letters](https://cenjun.com/){:target="_blank"}—thanks for nothing Jun Cen—but the editorial illustration has been a worthwhile experience I hope to pursue in the future.

Here's a little collab between [Allen Quigley](https://www.allenquigley.com/){:target="_blank"} and me. He covered the colors while I created the icons.

The assignments kept coming, and I felt this illustration of a map girl beckoned back to an older style.

Benny Franks has seen better days, but I believe this quick illustration turned out well.

On the bottom left corner you will find another quick illustration. Notice the coat hanger question mark— perhaps it's too subtle!

These backpacks existed in several different forms atop several different backgrounds before ultimately going in a subtle direction.
