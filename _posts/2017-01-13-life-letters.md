Here's an unexpected project. As I was recovering from the intense Impact Report, I was given what seemed like a tiny assignment for UT's own Liberal Arts Magazine. No, I was not given the cover of [Life & Letters](https://cenjun.com/){:target="_blank"}—thanks for nothing Jun Cen—but the editorial illustration has been a worthwhile experience I hope to pursue in the future.

Here's a little collab between [Allen Quigley](https://www.allenquigley.com/){:target="_blank"} and me. He covered the colors while I created the icons.

The assignments kept coming, and I felt this illustration of a map girl beckoned back to an older style.

Benny Franks has seen better days, but I believe this quick illustration turned out well.

These backpacks existed in several different forms atop several different backgrounds before ultimately going in a subtle direction.
