One of the largest projects I had at Brenda Thompson Communications was creating material for [Thundercloud Subs](https://thundercloud.com/){:target="_blank"}

This piece is an infographic on various figures from the charity run that might give anyone unfamiliar with the trot the context for all my other designs. Ultimately, I believe that this square layout limited me, but perhaps If I had the ability to devote more time to it things would have been different.

I love the tradition of the ThunderCloud Subs Turkey Trot Art Contest, but that hand drawn turkey really does not make sense in the context of the infographic. Half of the icons were graciously borrowed from the noun project, specifically [Do charity by Guilherme Simoes from the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/uberux/collection/new-years-resolutions/?i=324691){:target="_blank"}. Can you tell which ones I created?

Additionally, here are a few Instagram photos I created for ThunderCloud Subs picnic campaign. It is no secret that Austin is known for its amazing parks, and it was fun to run around the city, sandwich in tow, on behalf of TCloud. Most of these pics hail from [East Austin pocket parks](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2009-04-17/767852/){:target="_blank"}, and of course, [Zilker](https://austintexas.gov/department/zilker-metropolitan-park){:target="_blank"} is featured prominently. The only snafu I encountered on this adventure was the sheer number of dogs interested in my sandwiches!
