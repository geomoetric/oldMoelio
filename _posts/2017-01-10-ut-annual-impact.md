Here is the behemoth of the fall 2016 semesterâ€” at my UT job, this was top priority for two months. The Annual Impact Report summarizes donor support and scholarly initiatives of the school year for UT's very own College of Liberal Arts.

I handled the beginings of this project and the wonderful [Allen Quigley](https://www.allenquigley.com/){:target="_blank"} finished it. Although pretty corporate and design-by-committee, I felt as though I learned a lot.

Truthfully, this project was an InDesign trial by fire. The scope and breadth of this project allowed me to hone my skills, and it always feels good to have a project go to press.
