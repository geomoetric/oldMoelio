Here is my final project from fall Typography I. My predicament is that the project was a source book— an overview of my entire semester. So how do I summarize a project that exists as a summary? Furthermore, how do I provide insightful commentary when all the rigmarole I wrote inside the book served double duty on this blog?

Well at least I can show off these intro pages. You can find the various chapters and projects in a similar format on my [archives](/archive/) page.

A little introductory commentary by my brother and me. My philosophy on these intro pages was that I did not want to waste precious design material before diving into the semester. I figured that I would include a few goofy pictures of myself at twenty, for something to look back upon, and as a joke for my classmates in the final critique.

The theme I pursued with this project was "classic guide book". Inspired by the likes of [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/drive){:target="_blank"}, [Green Books](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-green-book/){:target="_blank"}, and [Michael Schwab Illustrations](https://www.michaelschwab.com/posters.html){:target="_blank"}. The icons above are from the [US Parks Service](https://thenounproject.com/edward/collection/national-park-service/){:target="_blank"} and denote assignments and themes on each project page.

Plus, I got to create the book in real life! It miraculously exists in this French-folded form thanks to Elmer's glue and the book press I believe I used incorrectly. I love the way it turned out and I hope more print media is in my future.
